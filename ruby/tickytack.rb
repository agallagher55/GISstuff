# TIC TAC TOE
# Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the game is displayed in between turns.

# Think about how you would set up the different elements within the gameâ€¦ What should be a class? 
# Instance variable? Method? A few minutes of thought can save you from wasting an hour of coding.

# Build your game, taking care to not share information between classes any more than you have to.

# Get input from user1, add input to game, show game, get input from user2

# Classes
# Player, game
